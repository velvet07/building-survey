# Drawing Module v1.0 Summary

## Overview
The drawing module has reached its 1.0 milestone. The current implementation delivers the stabilized canvas interactions, tablet-friendly toolbar, and Supabase-backed persistence that were iteratively refined throughout development.

## Key Capabilities
- Canvas sizing adheres to paper presets (A4 and A3) with landscape and portrait orientation support.
- Pointer input is clamped to the active paper bounds, preventing strokes from spilling outside the page area.
- Pen strokes capture densely sampled points so tablets render smooth continuous lines without gaps.
- The grid background shows enhanced millimeter markings with stronger lines every 0.5 cm and 1 cm for improved readability.
- Toolbar presents pens horizontally above the canvas with dropdown selectors for color and pen weight, optimized for touch interaction.
- Eraser supports both band (pixel erasing) and stroke removal modes, keeping the background intact.
- Autosave runs in the background and synchronizes canvas updates without requiring a manual save button.
- Pinch-to-zoom (touch) and wheel zoom (desktop) interactions are available while maintaining paper alignment.

## Next Steps
- Publish the current branch to GitHub as the official Drawing Module v1.0 baseline.
- Branch from this commit to start the Aquapol form work, for example:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/aquapol-form
  ```
- Reuse the stabilized Supabase configuration and autosave pipeline when integrating the Aquapol form to ensure consistent persistence behavior.
