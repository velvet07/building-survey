## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Manual Testing Required)

**You should now test the application manually in your browser:**

1. **Open Application**
   ```
   URL: http://localhost:3000
   Server is already running in background
   ```

2. **Test Authentication Flow**
   - [ ] Register new account (test@example.com)
   - [ ] Check email for confirmation
   - [ ] Confirm email in Supabase Dashboard or email
   - [ ] Login with credentials
   - [ ] Verify redirect to dashboard

3. **Test Project Management**
   - [ ] Navigate to /dashboard/projects
   - [ ] Create new project
   - [ ] Verify auto-generated ID (PROJ-20250929-001)
   - [ ] Edit project name
   - [ ] Delete project
   - [ ] Verify toast notifications

4. **Test Security**
   - [ ] Try accessing /dashboard without login (should redirect)
   - [ ] Logout and verify cannot access protected pages
   - [ ] Create projects as different users
   - [ ] Verify users only see their own projects (RLS)

5. **Test UI/UX**
   - [ ] Check responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - [ ] Test all buttons and modals
   - [ ] Verify loading states
   - [ ] Check toast notifications appear
   - [ ] Test form validations

**Full test cases:** See `docs/QA_TESTING.md` (55 test cases)

### After Manual Testing Passes

**Deploy to Production:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect Netlify to repository
3. Configure build settings
4. Add environment variables in Netlify
5. Deploy to production
6. Test production environment

**See:** `docs/NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
